I use photography as a way of expressing myself and appreciating the world around me. I mostly use it as an excuse to be surrounded by the things I love and attempting to freeze moments of enjoyment in time. [This video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJdWAXh2uG0) explains this point quite eloquently.

## Technical details
That being said, I also enjoy the purely technical aspects of photography. Being a mobile developer by trade, I've spent a good time exploring the limits of what I could achieve using only my mobile phone, be it via my [Moment Lens](https://shopmoment.com) or by custom written software to stack star photographies taken with my phone. 

Lately I've been learning how to shoot manual using my [X-T30II](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t30-ii/), which leads to tons of blurry underexposed shots (and some that are usable).

## Subjects
I mainly have three interests in photography: Birds, Stars and my loved ones. If my loved ones are near a starry sky or a bird then that's a plus.

Most of my star pictures are taken with my phone. I'm not into deep sky photography, my interest in photographing the sky is instead limited to using it as part of exploring composition. Since I've bought my camera I still haven't had time to try it in a proper dark sky. Maybe one day.
