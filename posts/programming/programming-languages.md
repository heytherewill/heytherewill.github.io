My favorite languages to write code in are [F#](https://fsharp.org/) and [Kotlin](kotlinlang.org/). They are a good mix between having functional features but still being able to get things done without having to jump too many hoops to keep referential transparency. They also run on top of large VMs that I have worked professionally in (the CLR and the JVM), meaning I understand how they will run and their memory model fairly well.

## Professional
I'm very well versed in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp), but I avoid using it for personal projects unless it's for writing games because I can just use F# instead. Same applies for [Java](https://www.java.com/en/): I'm and Android engineer, so I've writen a lot of it, but I'd rather use Kotlin if I can pick.

Being a mobile dev, I've also written [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) professionally. Though my knownledge on iOS is not as thorough as my knownledge on Android, I can find my way and get by in Swift codebases.

## Back to Basics
Lately I've been writing a lot of Software in C. There's beauty in its simplicity and a certain zen about your solution being nothing but what's needed for the problem to be solved.

## Misc.
I script in [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.4) (yeah, I know). I really enjoy [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I've worked professionally with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) at the beginning of my career and these days everyone needs to write some JavaScript every now and then. I also write [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) in every opportunity I get because I think it's a lovely language.
