This is a list of open source applications that I made on my own (as in, not paid by a contractor to do). I mostly write software that solves problems I have myself and then open source it because it might be useful for someone else.

## Professional work

At the beginning of my career I developed many Windows Phone apps and worked for a couple of start-ups that no longer exist. I also worked on some line of business applications. The places where I had the most significant impact are the [Toggl](toggl.com) mobile apps (worked as an architect and conducted a rewrite of both apps that made the apps climb to 4.7+ stars), [PSPDFKit](pspdfkit.com)'s Android and Windows frameworks and most recently I work at the squad responsible for the performance and stability of the [Spotify](https://spotify.com) Android client.
