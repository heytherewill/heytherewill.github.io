Refractor is a tool I wrote for myself and that I made open source because it could be useful for others. One thing that annoys me is finding a color in a format and needing to manually convert it to a different format in order to use it in whatever software/programming language I need. I did the only logic thing which is spending hours writing a tool that saves me these precious seconds. I used this as an opportunity to write a complete program in C, something I had never done before.
