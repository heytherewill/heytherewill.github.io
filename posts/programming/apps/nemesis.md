Nemesis is an app that serves as a companion for playing [Arch Enemy](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Archenemy_(format)), a game mode for [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) that I really enjoy. I'm working on huge refactor that turns the now Android only application into a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) one so that it can be released for other platforms as well. Once I get through it, then I will make it open source.
